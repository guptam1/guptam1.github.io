      <p> Hello! I am the Lieutenant Governor for Division 31, which includes the Key Clubs of Wilton, Westport, Weston, and Norwalk. My primary job is to pass crucial information from the District
         Board to these clubs, and I do this through my monthly newsletters. These newsletters have information pertinent to specific key clubs and the district as a whole. I, also, organize regional
         and divisional training conferences, where I get to meet the people in my and surrounding divisions.  A few other lieutenant governors and I recently held a regional training conference at
         Southington High School, and it was such an amazing experience! These conferences are aimed at training club presidents and officers. The training we had in December was aimed specifically to
          promote service projects and holding officer workshops - we were able to give all the officers specific information they could use to improve their individual key clubs.  </p>
      <p> On the New England and Bermuda District board, I serve on the Kiwanis Family Committee and the Districts Projects Committee. The Kiwanis family committee promotes Key Club
        and other levels of the Kiwanis family in an elementary, middle, and collegiate school level. And the Districts Projects committee emphasizes and publicizes the 3 district projects,
         the Kiwanis pediatric trauma institute (KPTI), Camp Sunshine, and Children of Peace International (COPI). </p>

      <h2 id="Division31Updates">Division 31 Goals and Proposals</h2>
        <p> For the 2019-2020 year, I have many goals and a program proposal for the Division 31 Key Clubs. 
          For all of the clubs, I want to implement a program, where key clubbers will have the opportunity to dedicate one hour 
          of their time each week helping the community in any way they choose to, now this could be reading books to kids at the 
          library, helping out senior citizens at the nearest nursing home, or even volunteer-tutoring a fellow classmate. I was
          talking about this idea with one of my friends, who really enjoys knitting - and she said it would be helpful if a few 
          high schoolers met up for one hour a week and knit hats for newborns at the hospital. I really like this idea because the 
          options are endless- itâ€™s such a nice way for students, maybe even from the middle school and elementary school, to get
          involved with the community. </p>

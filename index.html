      <p> Hello! I am the Lieutenant Governor for Division 31, which includes the Key Clubs of Wilton, Westport, Weston, and Norwalk. My primary job is to pass crucial information from the District
         Board to these clubs, and I do this through my monthly newsletters. These newsletters have information pertinent to specific key clubs and the district as a whole. I, also, organize regional
         and divisional training conferences, where I get to meet the people in my and surrounding divisions.  A few other lieutenant governors and I recently held a regional training conference at
         Southington High School, and it was such an amazing experience! These conferences are aimed at training club presidents and officers. The training we had in December was aimed specifically to
          promote service projects and holding officer workshops - we were able to give all the officers specific information they could use to improve their individual key clubs.  </p>
      <p> On the New England and Bermuda District board, I serve on the Kiwanis Family Committee and the Districts Projects Committee. The Kiwanis family committee promotes Key Club
        and other levels of the Kiwanis family in an elementary, middle, and collegiate school level. And the Districts Projects committee emphasizes and publicizes the 3 district projects,
         the Kiwanis pediatric trauma institute (KPTI), Camp Sunshine, and Children of Peace International (COPI). </p>
